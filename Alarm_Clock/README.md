Create an alarm clock. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).


**Features**

  - Clock showing the current time (seconds,mins,hrs should change as time changes)

* Set Alarm
  - Provide input boxes to set an alarm (hr,min,sec, am/pm)
  - Once the sets the time and click “Set Alarm” button, add that alarm to the alarms list below
  - When the alarm goes of just use JS alert function to alert in the browser

+ Alarms list
  - Display a list of all the alarms set by user

+ Delete alarm
  - For each alarm give a delete button to delete the alarm
  - When the user deletes an alarm make sure it “does not alerts the user”
